# The wage of a worker
# Calculation of the wage of a worker depending on 3 elements
# The first element is length, the second one is width and the third is the price of the worker per meter
# The process is done by multiplying the width and the length of the meters that the worker has built in the first step
# Then multiplying the result that came from the first step by the price of the worker per meter
# The final outcome woll be the total price that the worker would get for his work
